I used MVVM with Android Architecture Components (ViewModel + LiveData). With the help of ViewModel and LiveData that helps the data survive from configuration change and makes the ViewModel decouple from View throught observers that makes it highly testable and easy to modify or fix.

### Features (Some are not used but I retain the code)
* Dependency Injection using [Dagger](https://github.com/google/dagger)
* [Retrofit](https://square.github.io/retrofit/) x [RxJava & RxAndroid](https://github.com/ReactiveX/RxAndroid)
* [Timber](https://github.com/JakeWharton/timber) for logs.
* Unit Testing
* Continuous Integration using CircleCI
